# verbose {on|off}
#
# With get, any on/off parameter is ignored and the current verbose state is returned.
# With set, sets the verbose state as specified.
# When verbose mode is on, all set commands return positive acknowledgement in the form SET <COMMAND> ACK,
# and text error messages will be issued (FIXME: I donâ€™t know what this means).
# The verbose state is local to each connection, and starts out OFF on new connections.
